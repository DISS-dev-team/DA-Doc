Overall, API Gateway is a valuable solution that simplifies data integration, streamlines workflows, and enhances productivity.

## Addendum

If a report has more than one Addendum, the studies will not be duplicated in the final presentation, but the most recent Addendum will prevail.

Regarding Reports that contain more than one study, all of them are considered and uploaded to DISS Analytics.

## Test studies and calibration

Another important issue to note is that test and calibration studies, as well as those without an Accession Number, will be ignored. In this way, these studies will not affect the doctor's bill.
